##CLIPWKS -Spreadsheet Library##

CLIPWKS allows you to create native spreadsheets from Clipper. You can create Lotus 1-2-3, Microsoft Excel, and Quattro Pro 
spreadsheets using Clipper code. CLIPWKS includes all source code and is written mostly in Clipper with a few small functions 
in C and ASM (although Clipper code is provided as well). CLIPWKS support Lotus versions 2-4 and Excel version up to and 
including version 4.0. Excel 5.x and above store the spreadsheets in OLE structured storage container that cannot be reliably 
accessed from a DOS program.

[Microsoft](http:www.microsoft.com) did provide me code samples in C++ to access structured storage from a DOS product, but as Clipper and DOS 
programming in general was beginning to fade, I decided not to add that functionality to my product.
